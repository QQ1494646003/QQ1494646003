Given a string A consisting only of '(' and ')'.You need to find whether parantheses in A is balanced or not ,if it is balanced then return 1 else return 0.

Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (push, top, pop, and empty).Implement the MyStack class:void push(int x) Pushes element x to the top of the stack.int pop() Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.int top() Returns the element on the top of the stack.boolean empty() Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.

Given a string A representing an absolute path for a file (Unix-style).Return the string A after simplifying the absolute path.

Given a string A denoting an expression. It contains the following operators ’+’, ‘-‘, ‘*’, ‘/’.Chech whether A has redundant braces or not.Return 1 if A has redundant braces, else return 0.

Given a string A denoting a stream of lowercase alphabets. You have to make new string B.B is formed such that we have to find first non-repeating character each time a character is inserted to the stream and append it at the end to B. If no non-repeating character is found then append '#' at the end of B.

Given an array of integers A. There is a sliding window of size B which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the w numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves rightwards by one position. You have to find the maximum for each window. The following example will give you more clarity.

Given an array, find the nearest smaller element G[i] for every element A[i] in the array such that the element has an index smaller than i.More formally,G[i] for an element A[i] = an element A[j] such that j is maximum possible AND  j < i AND A[j] < A[i]Elements for which no smaller element exist, consider next smaller element as -1.

Given an array of integers A .A represents a histogram i.e A[i] denotes height of the ith histogram's bar. Width of each bar is 1.Find the area of the largest rectangle formed by the histogram.

Given an integer array A of non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
