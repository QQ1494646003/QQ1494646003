Max Heap is a special kind of complete binary tree in which for every node the value present in that node is greater than the value present in itâ€™s children nodes.
Find the number of distinct Max Heap can be made from A distinct integers.In short, you have to ensure the following properties for the max heap :Heap has to be a complete binary tree ( A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.)Every node is greater than all its children.

Given two integers arrays A and B of size N each.Find the maximum N elements from the sum combinations (Ai + Bj) formed from elements in array A and B.

Given an array A , representing seats in each row of a stadium. You need to sell tickets to B people.Each seat costs equal to the number of vacant seats in the row it belongs to. The task is to maximize the profit by selling the tickets to B people.

Given N bags, each bag contains Bi chocolates. There is a kid and a magician. In one unit of time, kid chooses a random bag i, eats Bi chocolates, then themagician fills the ith bag with floor(Bi/2) chocolates.Find the maximum number of chocolates that kid can eat in A units of time.

Given two equally sized 1-D arrays A, B containing N integers each.A sum combination is made by adding one element from array A and another element of array B.Return the maximum C valid sum combinations from all the possible sum combinations.

You are given an array of N integers, A1, A2 ,..., AN and an integer B. Return the of count of distinct numbers in all windows of size B. Formally, return an array of size N-B+1 where i'th element in this array contains number of distinct elements in sequence Ai, Ai+1 ,..., Ai+B-1.Design and implement a data structure for LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. It should support the following operations: get and set.
